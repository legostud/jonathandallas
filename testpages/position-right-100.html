<p>Everest Poker offers two popular poker games, Texas Hold’em and Omaha Poker. Both require two to 10 people to play poker and use shared “community” cards to build a hand. However, each game warrants different poker strategies. Use the links below to review the basic rules for these two poker games, learn what hand beats what, and expand your poker vocabulary.</p>

<p>Your poker education should begin with the basics, so before you play poker, you must learn the rules of the game. But remember: poker is poker, so whether you play poker in a casino room or online poker in the comfort of your own home, the rules are exactly the same.</p>
