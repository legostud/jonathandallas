      Our real agenda:  To propose that a cookie could break a curse, any curse,
        let alone this one, is a bit of a stretch. But it's not a totally
        crazy idea. This is a baseball thing after all. Here's something
        crazier and much bigger. Perhaps simple acts of kindness &amp; generosity - performed
        in OVERWHELMING numbers - could make it happen.
      <p>Yes, we are proposing that good-hearted people, acting together, can
        change the karma. At worst we'll make a positive difference in
        the daily life of New Englanders. </p>
      <p>Break a cookie and share it with a friend or stranger. Then do another
        random nice thing - perhaps for a New Yorker. Repeat often (with
        or without the cookie). <a href="#rntdd">Click here</a> for a list of
        RNT's (Random Nice Thing) suggestions.</p>
      <p>Sharing a cookie or a smile is just a nice little thing, but a lot of
        nice little things can add up to a huge movement. That's what is
        called for.</p>

        <strong>RNT</strong> (Random Nice Thing)<br>
RNT is a cumulative score of all the RNTs we receive by individuals throughout
the planet and then takes into account the Red Sox position in the standings,
their ERA (Earned Run Average), batting average, and OBP (On-Base Percentage)
and adjusted against the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It is also influenced
by OPK. Within hours of the Sox recording the last out of the World Series and
winning their first title in 86 years, the OPK score skyrocketed off the charts
- literally unrecordable - before evening out at a score of 37. <a href="#rntrs"> Click
here</a> to see some of the individual RNT's reported in.</p>
      <p><strong>OPK</strong> (Overwhelmingly Positive Karma)<br>
  OPK is a general market indicator of the positive karma sweeping any given
    area and influences both KBI and RNT figures. The OPK never fell below 83
    during the playoffs, and reached a then record 91 after beating the Yankees.
    With the World Series victory, the OPK reached an all time high of 97, with
    OPK coming in from all parts of the globe including strong karma from the
    state of Missouri.</p>
      <p><strong>KBI</strong> (Karma Batted In)<br>
  Is currently running at a record score of 99. We have been tracking this number
    since Opening Day and it has steadily risen in direct relation to Red Sox
    victories. It is also influenced by OPK. After winning their wildcard berth
    in late September, KPI rose to a then season-high 94. It dipped to 79 after
    the Sox fell behind 3 games to 0 against the Yankees, but took a steep and
    steady climb since, culminating with the Series victory over the Cardinals
    on October 27th.</p>

        <p>&#8226; When in a restaurant we noticed a young couple with two small
          children. <br>
  At the end of our meal we went over and told them what sweet, well behaved
  children they had. Hope that made their day! <em>AC, Santa Monica, CA</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; My mother sent me two dozen of your Break the Curse cookies.
          Unfortunately, they are delicious. Way too good to share with anyone
          besides my children. So, one RNT for mom in Massachusetts although
          the scale will not thank me. <em>Virginia L. Glen Rock NJ</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; After receiving my "Break the Curse" cookie...I
          didn't eat it, and instead, brought it home to my husband who
          couldn't attend the Opening Day game - and I let him have
          it. WE BOTH love the Molasses Clove Cookies - I mean LOVE them,
          therefore, you'll understand just how nice of a RNT this actually
        was. <em>Catherine C., West Boylston, MA        </em>
        <p>&#8226; Today I had to bring my dog, Sheba, to the vet's and when
          I got there it was packed and people said the wait was approx. 1 hour.
          Well,
          it came down to me and this other guy about an hour later...he had
          been there well before me (and a few others that were called before
          him)...then they called my name and instead of just going with the
          nurse, I told the nurse that this gentleman had been here for much
          longer than me, and when they checked, he had somehow gotten lost in
        the shuffle so I allowed him to go ahead of me. He was really grateful..... <em>Karen
        L. </em>       
        <p>&#8226; I give my mail man cookies! and I get the best mail service
          anyone can get! <em>Sabrina M., Watertown, MA</em>
        <p>&#8226; I live a comfortable life and have access to great entertainment.
          I have tickets to all the Celtics games. Next weekend instead of going
          myself or taking frieinds, I'm giving them to some kids who never
          have that chance. I'm donating 4 tickets to each of three games to
        the Kids Can Dream Fund. <em>Bob H., Cambridge, MA</em>         
        <p>&#8226; I passed out a &quot;Break the Curse&quot; cookie to every
          student and teacher at the Wilbraham and Monson Blake Middle School
          this morning!
          Collectively, we are huge Red Sox fans, and I know that if positive
          thinking and the act of performing random nice things could win the
          World Series, our school would throw the winning pitch or score the
          winning run! <em>Betsy T.

        <p>&#8226; All Tie playoff games going into the 9th inning are watched
          in my bathtub with my shower radio(fully dressed of course). Radio
          comes in about 6 seconds faster then the TV, which allows me to know
          when David Ortiz hits the walk off homerun before all of my clueless
        friends watching the TV. <em>Keith R.</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; I'm pretty crazy when it comes to being superstitious.  It
          all depends on where I am. Here is an example. If I'm at a bar and
          actual have a seat at the bar watching the game, it is crucial that
          I have the label on my beer bottle facing 2:00. The bottle must be
          placed on 1 cocktail napkin and I can never hold the beer while the
          pitcher is holding the ball. This is just one of many ridiculous habits
          I have. I started this one during the 7th inning of the Red Sox Yankees
          Game on Sunday July 27, 2003. The Red Sox came from behind and won
        the game.</p>
        <p>A also have to leave my living room and hang out in the kitchen of
          my Apartment in South Boston anytime Manny or David Ortiz (Dortz) are
          at the plate. I also watched the final drive of the 2001 Patriots Super
          Bowl victory on a 5 inch portable T.V. in my bathroom. Yeah....I've
        got it bad. Boston Fans Rule! <em>Dave L. S. Boston, MA</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; To break the curse I take my cookies to the beach. I appeal
          to that deep tidal knowledge - that deep eternal understanding, embedded
          in nature itself, that what falls must eventually RISE. Right? Must.
          So I stand at the edge of the sea with my Break-the-Curse cookies (with
          86 of them, to be exact), and I wait for that precise moment when THE
          TIDE TURNS, when it stops dropping and starts to come back up. (In
          truth, I don't wait long, on account of the tide charts available on
          the internet tell me precisely when this moment occurs. Happens twice
          a day, it turns out.) Then, as the waves again begin to stretch toward
          high water, I begin to feed the cookies to the sea. I throw them in.
          One at a time. Mostly overhand, sometimes side-arm (mimicking Pedro's
          new, unfortunately lower, arm slot), and from time to time submarine-style.
          I make the tides this offering. The tides no doubt appreciate it. (How
          could they not? These are outstanding cookies.) The tides, their attentions
          thus focused on this particular baseball matter at hand, will thus
          exert their pull on our Red Sox club's fates. The tides will say: "ENOUGH
          with the falling. Eighty six years - it's unnatural. It's time, this
          year, to RISE." I mean, that's what they'd say if they could talk.
          But you get the idea. <em>Suz E., Roxbury, MA</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; What I do is, I eat cookies. That's how I break the curse.
          Doesn't matter where I am, but it's good if I'm watching a game, but
          it's all right if I'm not. It still works. My ritual: What I do is
          I eat a whole pack. Then I rub my belly for a little. Then I eat another
          whole pack. I'm pretty sure I have to do it all season, every day.
          I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure. <em>Dwight M., Cambridge, MA</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; To break the curse, this is what I will do, tonight, as we
          all begin to assemble around Fenway for the Yankees, the happy people
          with tickets
          and the hopeful people looking for scalpers so they can get some. I'll
          approach the hopeful people with my cookies and say to them, "Friend,
          you may not get a ticket tonight--it being the Yankees, after all--but
          you can play a part in breaking the curse anyway. Here." And
          I will extend a cookie in one hand and ask them to break off a part
          of it, which will be for them to eat. I will eat the other part, and
          we will clap each other on the shoulder and wordlessly acknowledge
          that just as the cookie has been broken and enjoyed, so will be the
          curse and its antithesis--our inevitable World Series victory. I will
          do this with as many of the hopeful, ticket-seeking people as I can
          find.
Tonight there will be a lot of them. <em>John M.,  Needham, MA</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; I'm Dutch, and we're a practical people, though
          not unromantic. Hence, we do break curses, but by practical means.
          And romantically. My American friends here in the New England are so
          troubled by this Curse of Bambino that I have decided to help. Especially
          because I love cookies. (In Amsterdam the cookies are not this good.)
          To break the curse I pick up a Break-the-Curse cookie in my left hand
          (I am left-handed) and pick up a Red Sox cap in my right. I say to
          the hat, "This curse is broken." Then with my left hand
          I snap the cookie in half. (I break it, see?) Then I eat it. The cookie,
          not the hat.
After that, I kiss one of my friends. That's the romantic part. My friends
appear to believe that this ritual will work. <em>Els B.,  Portland, ME</em></p>
        <p>&#8226; Here is my pal Gerry and my ritual:<br>
          1. We spread a very large plastic garbage bag on the ground (the lawn-and-leaf
            kind is best);<br>
          2. Gerry positions himself on center of bag, and squats down, like
          Varitek;<br>
          3. I pace off exactly 60 feet, 6 inches from an imaginary home plate
          right in front of Gerry, and toe the rubber on imaginary pitcher's
          mound;<br>
          4.	Gerry, who is Varitek, and me--I'm Pedro--imagine Posada's
          at the plate. (You know the situation, don't make me describe
          it);<br>
          5. Gerry puts down two fingers--curveball--and I remove first cookie
          from package and throw it to him. (Sort of frisbee style; it's
          not so hard after you get the hang of it);<br>
          6.	If it goes over the imaginary plate and Gerry catches it, it's
          a strike. If it misses the plate or Gerry drops it (this is where garbage
          bag comes in; cookies fall on it, stay clean, and later you get to
          eat them anyway), it doesn't count;<br>
          7. Continue removing cookies from packages and throwing them until
          you have thrown THREE STRIKES past imaginary Posada, and he's
          out. Got it? OUT. No stupid broken-bat dumb-luck bloop hit deal, just
          OUT. And the good thing is, when you do it this way, Posada never even
          has a chance to hit the cookie, understand? Because he's IMAGINARY.
          That's the good thing;<br>
          8.	After you've struck out Posada, eat whatever cookies or parts
          of cookies that have been involved in the operation.<br>

        <p>&#8226; We on the North Side of Chicago are very familiar with curses
          and long droughts in baseball. If your Break the Curse Cookie works
          for Boston, I'll ask you to create one for the Cubs next year... <em>John

        <p>&#8226; I was given a Break the Curse cookie by my boss for my birthday!
          As I drove home and listened to the game on the radio I placed the
          cookie in a nook on my dashboard. That night after a five game losing
          streak, the Red Sox won. The cookie will stay there for the remainder
          of the 2004 Season in hopes that the winning will continue! I drive
          to Worcester from Western Massachusetts every day. In my rear window
          is a Red Sox banner from my first game in April of 1953. Underneath
          the banner is the year 2004 because this is the year!! I will never
        lose hope! </p>
        <p>I also keep my Break the Curse cookie as a reminder that some of the
          proceeds go to The Sweet Home Project, a collaboration of Dancing Deer
          and One Family. <em> Ruth C, Wilbraham, MA </em></p>
        <p>&#8226; During game 5&amp;6 of the ALCS, my husband had a 7th inning
          ritual in sharing a Break the Curse cookie with our Beagle Fred. Due
          to their
          obvious magic powers, my husband and I traveled to game 7 of the ALCS
          in NY and each clutched our two remaining Break the Curse Cookies during
          the game. (Fred was relegated to the kennel) They are now a packet
          of crumbs!! 
          We believe they did the trick.
          Great job - you have a quality product (&amp; marketing organization)<br>

			  &#8226; I run a site that preaches positive vibes for the Guild of Red
			  Sox Nation Union Members and it was great to join the "circus" on that first
			  Yankee-Sox weekend outside Fenway Park. At first, I saw all these
			  different people "preaching their particular gospel" with regards to Red
			  Sox Nation and thought to myself "there ain't enough sidewalk for all of
			  us." But when
			  I grabbed a delicious cookie and starting talking to everyone,
			  we sort of all banded together and helped each other out. The Beat
			  the Yankees guys
			  from NH were telling people to sign up for the Guild of Red Sox
			  Nation.com; the "from cursed to first girls" were taking pictures around
			  the banner the "Beat the Yankees" guys had; and we all chowed on a cookie
			  or two and were telling fans to go grab a "lucky cookie" from the crazy
			  kid wearing just a t-shirt or the pretty brunette a little more
			  appropriately dressed for the chilly
			  weather. I'm also happy to report that i was able to muster up
			  enough will power to bring a few tasty morsels out to the West
			  Coast and I think the
			  paperboy is finally going to reach the front porch for a change!<br>

          1) Climb Mt. Everest. Leave a Red Sox hat at top. Burn a Yankees cap. 
          Sound extreme? Well, Paul Giorgio did just that on the advice of a Tibetan 
          Buddhist holy man in 2001. To read more go to: <a href="http://www.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2001/0620/1216282.html" target="_blank">www.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2001/0620/1216282.html</a></p>
        <p>2) Refurbish a piano. Not just any piano but the one that Babe Ruth 
          owned and supposedly tossed into Willis Pond in Massachusetts. In 2002 
          the Restoration Project sponsored one such expedition with the goal 
          to refurbish the piano and play it again at Fenway Park. Sadly, water 
          visibility was poor so divers were unable to locate the piano. To read 
          more go to: <a href="http://www.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/0223/1339763.html" target="_blank">www.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/0223/1339763.html</a></p>
        <p>3) Practice Feng Shui. Local residents from Arglington, MA performed 
          rituals at Fenway to lift the curse. Tools included broken glass, sage, 
          sweet grass, red candles, a picture of the Babe, a pot, rattles, bells. 
          The duo turned to a Buddhist expression,"Nam-mycho-renge-kyo" to channel 
          positive energy to the park. To read more go to: <a href="http://www.townonline.com/arlington/news/local_regional/aa_newaacurse09252003.htm" target="_blank">www.townonline.com/arlington/news/local_regional/aa_newaacurse09252003.htm

      <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF"><a name="hist"></a>History of the Curse:</font></strong><br>
&quot;Since 1920, the Boston Red Sox have been plagued with the curse of Babe
Ruth. The owner of the team at the time needed some fast cash and sold Babe to
the New York Yankees. Ever since, despite many close calls, our beloved Sox have
not won the World Series. So please do your part to bring home a world championship
and take a bite of our special &quot;Break the Curse Cookie&quot;</p>
