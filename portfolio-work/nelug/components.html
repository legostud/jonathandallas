	On
	 11&amp;12 Feb 2012 the New England LEGO Users Group (NELUG) set a new 
	world record for the longest contiguous LEGO monorail track at 730 feet 
	(222.5 meters).  The event, dubbed the MR730 Event, was held at the 
	Wenham Museum in Wenham, MA.  The two day show featured a layout divided
	 into 4 themes; space, city, carnival and forest/castle, with monorail 
	track running throughout.  Highlights included two amazing structures 
	that held 11 levels of monorail track, working carnival rides, and 5 
	custom monorail trains.  A video of the MR730 Event can be found at <a href="http://www.nelug.org/links/portal.php?what=link&amp;item=" title="" class="ext-link"></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/riplego/6862346673/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/riplego/6862346673/</a> or search Flickr for "MR730 Event".<br>

			It
	 started off simply enough.  Eric Kingsley saw a video of a LEGO moon 
	base  display by the Ontario Brick Builders which featured over 250 feet
	 of monorail track.  As far as we could discover, that was the longest 
	monorail track that had been publicly displayed.  Eric thought that as a
	 club we could best that and start a friendly little monorail 
	competition among  the Lego User Groups.<br>
	<br>
	The next step was to see how much monorail track we could gather 
	together.  Quite a bit as it turns out.  So then we needed to figure out
	 where and when we could create a display.  One of our favorite shows 
	every year is the Wenham Museum in Wenham Massachusetts and they were 
	willing to let us try something a little different this year.  We now 
	had a venue, but one that presented a challenge.  How many linear feet 
	of track can fit into about 280 square feet of display space?  Well the 
	answer is that if you are willing to go vertical, very vertical, you can
	 fit in over 700 feet of monorail.<br>
	<br>
	Come by the museum on February 11th or 12th to see if all our planning 
	and building will pay off with a new LEGO monorail record.  In addition 
	to some rather impressive towers which support up to eleven levels of 
	looping track, the display will feature a city, moon base, castle, and 
	carnival.  It should be pretty special.<br>
