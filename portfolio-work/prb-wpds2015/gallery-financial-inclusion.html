						<p>Financial inclusion—making appropriate, affordable, and convenient financial services available to all people—is a global development priority. For women, access to savings, credit, and other services can help them gain more financial independence, better manage and leverage their resources, and build capital to support income-generating activities. A core measure of financial inclusion is whether an individual uses an account at a bank or other formal financial institution. In most countries, even many least developed ones, the share of women with such accounts has increased over the past few years. Gaps remain between men and women, but these have narrowed in many cases, and most developed countries show effective gender parity at high levels of usage. Rapid expansion of mobile money and other financial services available via mobile devices, particularly in Africa, provide a convenient way for both men and women to access such services. Women are currently using mobile more than other formal accounts in several African countries.</p>
