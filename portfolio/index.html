              >. Converted Illustrator designs into working HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. I was able to reuse some of the exisiting JavaScript
              from 2014 to do the scrolling. Note: the Data Sheet section was
              built by a co-worker.

              Brain Games -
              <a href="portfolio-work/blink-test/">blinking circles</a>. Are the
              inner circles blinking at the same time or alternating? Used
              JavaScript to switch an id value at a set interval. CSS then
              changes the color.

              Experiment with responsive design of the
              <a href="/portfolio-work/nelug/">NELUG</a> website. This prototype
              was built as a mobile site that then adds content and high
              resolution images as the browser increases in size. JavaScript and
              media queries were used to create the affect.

              Light weight
              <a href="/portfolio-work/zoom">product zoom</a> widget designed to
              replace a Flash based version in an attempt to improve site
              performance. This prototype uses jQuery to display an element with
              a larger background image of the product over the smaller one. The
              position of the background image is then adjusted as you mouse
              over it.

              Reskin of the
              <a href="portfolio-work/ep-reskin/">Everest Poker</a> website.
              Stakeholders wanted to quickly (2 weeks) update the look and feel
              of the entire Everest Poker website. I found a way with just using
              CSS and adjusting some of the CMS content to pull this off. A
              rough version was shown to them within an hour using just the
              Firebug console.

              Promotion page for
              <a href="/portfolio-work/ep-laronda/">Laronda</a> built within a
              Plone CMS content type field. Content type had two wysiwyg editor
              fields and a raw html field. CSS and JavaScript was placed in the
              raw html field to style the content. I also added an Easter egg
              for fun - click on the computer five times to see the Easter egg

            <!-- li>Converted the <a href="http://www.everestcasino.com">Everest Casino</a> website from Perl Mason to Plone with a new look a feel.  Worked with a Plone developer to get the Plone framework setup and added to a new Mercurial repository.  To manipulate the default html for the various pages, I used Diazo to apply an XSL template.  CSS and JavaScript was then applied to finish off the design.  The site was also released in phases and was complete major sections.</li -->
