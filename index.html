						<h2>Portfolio Work</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>PRB World Population Data Sheet <a href="http://www.prb.org/wpds/2015/" target="_blank">(link)</a>.  Converted Illustrator designs into working HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I was able to reuse some of the exisiting JavaScript from 2014 to do the scrolling.  Note: the Data Sheet section was built by a co-worker.</li>
            				<li>Brain Games - <a href="portfolio-work/blink-test/">blinking circles</a>.  Are the inner circles blinking at the same time or alternating?  Used JavaScript to switch an id value at a set interval.  CSS then changes the color.</li> 
							<li>Experiment with responsive design of the <a href="/portfolio-work/nelug/">NELUG</a> website.  This prototype was built as a mobile site that then adds content and high resolution images as the browser increases in size.  JavaScript and media queries were used to create the affect.
							</li>
							<li>Light weight <a href="/portfolio-work/zoom">product zoom</a> widget designed to replace a Flash based version in an attempt to improve site performance.  This prototype uses jQuery to display an element with a larger background image of the product over the smaller one.  The position of the background image is then adjusted as you mouse over it.
							</li>
							<li>Reskin of the <a href="portfolio-work/ep-reskin/">Everest Poker</a> website.  Stakeholders  wanted to quickly (2 weeks) update the look and feel of the entire Everest Poker website.  I found a way with just using CSS and adjusting some of the CMS content to pull this off.  A rough version was shown to them within an hour using just the Firebug console.
							</li>
							<li>Promotion page for <a href="/portfolio-work/ep-laronda/">Laronda</a> built within a Plone CMS content type field.  Content type had two wysiwyg editor fields and a raw html field.  CSS and JavaScript was placed in the raw html field to style the content.  I also added an Easter egg for fun - click on the computer five times to see the Easter egg
							</li>
							<!-- li>Converted the <a href="http://www.everestcasino.com">Everest Casino</a> website from Perl Mason to Plone with a new look a feel.  Worked with a Plone developer to get the Plone framework setup and added to a new Mercurial repository.  To manipulate the default html for the various pages, I used Diazo to apply an XSL template.  CSS and JavaScript was then applied to finish off the design.  The site was also released in phases and was complete major sections.</li -->
							<!-- li>In preparation for the launch of a new Everest Poker site for France we needed to create a <a href="/portfolio-work/er-one-page-site/">landing page</a>.  One page design created from PSD mockups.
							</li -->
							<!-- li>Updated the look and feel of the <a href="/portfolio-work/imperialcasino/">Imperial Casino</a> website.  New homepage, download page, and interior page. Perl Mason templates were created and all new CSS (from scratch to remove old code) was added to the site.
							</li -->
							<!-- li>Custom <a href="/portfolio-work/ltd-404/">404 page</a> for the Live the Dream website</li -->
							<!-- li>Designed and built the <a href="http://www.kickasscupcakes.com">Kickass Cupcakes</a> website (built in 2007)
							</li -->
